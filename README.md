## Challenge
Provide insights to the revenue team in the hospitality domain.
##### Domain: Hospitality 
##### Function: Revenue


## Project Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other 
competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. 
However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Task
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents 
from the download section.

 - Create the metrics according to the metric list.
 - Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
 - Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
